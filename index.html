    <p>Instructions: At the start of the game you and the dealer will get two cards. One of the dealer's cards will not be visible.</p>
    <p>Your goal is to have a higher over number than the dealer; however, if you go over 21, you automatically lose.</p>
    <p>If you click "Hit Me!", you will draw another card.</p>
    <p>If you click "Stay!", the dealer will continue to draw cards until it either beats you, ties you, or busts (>21).</p>
    <p>Notes: Ace is always valued at 1. Jack/Queen/King are valued at 11.</p>
